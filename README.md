This was my first project using Vite. Initially made using tutorial of [JavaScipt Mastery](https://youtu.be/0fYi8SGA20k?feature=shared).

Work done on it other than the tutorial:-
- Removed unused CSS.
- Removed Extra Animations.
- Made UI Faster.
- Added a Resume Button (Where you can put a link to your resume).
- Enhanced Visibility and solved Responsive UI Problems.

This Project is hosted in Netlify : [3D Portfolio](https://portfoliobyompatel.netlify.app/)
